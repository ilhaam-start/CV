Prior to embarking on my journey into the world of Data Engineering, I completed a Bachelors in Accounting. Through my studies I built a strong foundation in analytical thinking and structured data management. I discovered my passion for data-driven decision making through a Business Data Analysis module I undertook. What truly excites me about technology and coding is the potential to unravel complex problems and transform raw data into actionable insights that drive business growth. As a driven and ambitious Data Engineering bootcamp graduate, I am eager to apply my newfound knowledge, dedication to continuous learning, and unwavering work ethic to contribute to data driven projects and help organisations achieve their goals.
